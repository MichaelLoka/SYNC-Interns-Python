# SYNC Interns Python
This is the October Patch of SYNC Interns Python Internship
This Repository Includes the tasks required alone the internship

## Task 1: Alarm Clock
The objective of our project is to implement an alarm clock using Python. 

Python consists of some very innovative libraries such as DateTime and tkinter which help us to build the project using the current date and time as well as to provide a user interface to set the alarm according to the requirement in 24-hour format.

## Task 2: OTP Verification
We can easily create an application for the task of OTP verification using Python by following the steps mentioned below: 
1. First, create a 6-digit random number. 
2. Then store the number in a variable 
3. Then we need to write a program to send emails.
4. we need to use OTP as a message when sending an email.
5. Finally, we need to request two user inputs; first for the user’s email and then for the OTP the user has received.

So this is the complete process of creating an OTP verification application using Python.

## Task 3: URL Shortener
You must have used various online URL shortening services and they all are doing a great job as well! Even Google Forms also uses shortened URLs for ease of use. So it’s a widely used service on the Internet.
Have you ever thought about or tried to shorten the URL length? Hopefully, there are plenty of libraries and APIs available in the Python programming language to help us do the same using programming.

## Task 4: Chatbot
A chatbot is a piece of software that mimics human dialogue through text chats, voice commands, or both.

Here are the 9 steps you will cover to help you get a chatbot :
1. Decide what type of chatbot is best for you. 
2. Determine your chatbot key performance indicator. 
3. Understand user needs.
4. Give your chatbot a personality. 
5. Plan your chatbot flow. 
6. Design your chatbot.
7. Preview and test your chatbot. 
8. Target your chatbot.
